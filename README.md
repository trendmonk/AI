## ⚙️ What is TrendMonk?

TrendMonk AI is not a bot.  
It's a decentralized intelligence fabric for navigating meme-token volatility in real-time — optimized for *human+AI co-trading* on Solana.

It integrates:

- ✅ On-chain flow analysis  
- ✅ Off-chain signal detection  
- ✅ LLM-powered narrative parsing  
- ✅ Wallet behavior profiling  
- ✅ Temporal signal scoring

Each module is a self-contained AI agent.  
Together, they form a swarm intelligence — constantly learning what makes degens move.

## 🧩 Agent Modules

| Agent ID | Name              | Function                                                  |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `TX-42`  | *MintSniper*      | Hooks into Pump.fun and monitors every token launch      |
| `W3-G1`  | *WalletTracker*   | Scores wallets based on speed, conviction, win-rate      |
| `SO-7A`  | *SignalSeeker*    | Detects unusual spikes in liquidity & buy walls          |
| `NLP-X9` | *NarrativeCrawler*| Scrapes GitHub, X, Telegram, web mentions — parses context |
| `X0-R8`  | *SentimentEngine* | LLM-fusion model detecting early meme traction           |

Each one operates independently and shares vectorized insights to a unified **Hype Map**.
